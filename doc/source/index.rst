S+LEAF documentation
====================

Installation
------------

The S+LEAF package can be installed using the pip utility

``pip install --extra-index-url https://obswww.unige.ch/~delisle spleaf``

and upgraded with

``pip install --extra-index-url https://obswww.unige.ch/~delisle spleaf --upgrade``

Usage
-----

The S+LEAF package provides two main classes:
:doc:`classes/spleaf.Spleaf` and :doc:`classes/spleaf.rv.Cov`.

The :doc:`classes/spleaf.Spleaf` class is
a generic low level implementation of S+LEAF (semiseparable + leaf) matrices
as defined by [1]_.

The :doc:`classes/spleaf.rv.Cov` class provides a higher level API
to model correlated noise in a radial velocity timeseries
using S+LEAF matrices (see also [1]_).

Examples of the use of the S+LEAF package are available at
`<https://gitlab.unige.ch/jean-baptiste.delisle/spleaf/tree/master/examples/>`_.
